# 🌿 Sufi Circle — WhatsApp Group Verification Portal

This project is a beautifully designed verification portal built for the **Sufi Circle** community.  
It ensures only genuine participants can join the WhatsApp group by completing a quick human verification step.  
The site also reflects the serene, traditional aesthetic of Sufi culture — featuring soft transparency, premium emerald and gold tones, and an elegant layout inspired by Islamic art.
